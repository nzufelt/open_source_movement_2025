# Resources for the Open Source Movement

In this repository, I list some of the resources for the course the Open Source Movement, taught in the spring of 2025 at Phillips Academy in Andover, MA.

* [Learning Git](https://github.com/nzufelt/resources_for_students/blob/master/git.md) — This website contains most of the module which comprises the primary work that students will complete in the course.
* [Repository Template](repository_template.md) — This template is used by students to pitch their repository idea to the rest of the class.
