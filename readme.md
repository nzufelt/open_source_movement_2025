# Resources for the Open Source Movement

In this repository, I list some of the resources for the course the Open Source Movement, taught in the spring of 2025 at Phillips Academy in Andover, MA.

* [Learning Git]() — This module comprises the primary work that students will complete in the course.
* [Repository Template](repository_template.md) — This template is used by students to pitch their repository idea to the rest of the class.
